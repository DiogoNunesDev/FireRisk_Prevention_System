The dataset enables the model to learn fine-grained distinctions between fire-prone and safe zones.

🏋️‍♂️ Training Process

The U-Net model was trained on the labeled dataset following a structured process:

Data Preprocessing:

Resized images to [dimensions] for consistency.

Applied data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, flips) to improve model robustness.

Model Training:

Framework: [TensorFlow/PyTorch].

Optimizer: [Adam/SGD] with an initial learning rate of [value].

Loss Function: Dice loss for better handling of imbalanced data.

python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 16

Validation:

Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

Monitored performance metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice Coefficient.

Checkpointing:

Best-performing models were saved during training for future evaluation.

Training logs and metrics are saved in the logs/ directory for further analysis.
